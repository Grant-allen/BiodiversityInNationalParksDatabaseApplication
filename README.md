This project used data gathered from The National Parks Service (NPS) 2017 database of animal and plant species identified in National Parks from observation, vouchers, reports that document species in the parks. The data contains 119,248 unique species from all 57 national parks. We took a subset of this data containing mammals, amphibians, birds, fish, and reptiles from Yellowstone, Glacier, and Grand Teton National Park. The subset contains 550 unique rows of species from three national parks.

The pages of this web application display the database tables and analysis results using reports, charts, and maps to investigate various characteristics of species and the parks they belong to.
